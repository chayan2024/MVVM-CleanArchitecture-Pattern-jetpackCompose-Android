## About
Android MVVM Starter with Kotlin, Hilt, Coroutines, Retrofit2, Kotlin Flow, MockK, Espresso, JUnit4, and Jetpack Compose

### Features:
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern for separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Kotlin Programming Language**: Written entirely in Kotlin, taking advantage of its concise syntax and modern features.
- **Hilt for Dependency Injection**: Utilizes Hilt, the recommended dependency injection library by Google, for managing dependencies and facilitating testing.
- **Coroutines and Kotlin Flow**: Employs Coroutines for asynchronous programming, enabling smooth and non-blocking execution of tasks. Kotlin Flow is used for reactive streams.
- **Retrofit2 for Network Requests**: Uses Retrofit2 for making HTTP requests to a RESTful API, handling network communication efficiently.
- **MockK for Mocking**: Implements MockK for creating mocks in unit tests, simplifying the testing process and improving code coverage.
- **Espresso for UI Testing**: Integrates Espresso for UI testing, ensuring the correctness and robustness of the user interface.
- **JUnit4 for Unit Testing**: Employs JUnit4 for unit testing, validating individual units of code in isolation and promoting test-driven development.
- **Jetpack Compose for UI Development**: Adopts Jetpack Compose for building modern and declarative UIs, enabling faster and more flexible UI development.

### Modules:
- **app**: Contains the main application code, including UI components, ViewModels, and business logic.
- **data**: Includes data-related components such as data sources, repositories, and network service implementations.
- **domain**: Defines the domain layer entities, use cases, and business logic.
- **presentation**: Contains presentation-related components like ViewModels, UI state management, and Jetpack Compose UI elements.
- **test**: Houses unit tests and UI tests for various modules.
